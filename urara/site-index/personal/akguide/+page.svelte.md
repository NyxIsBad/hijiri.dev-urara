# New X-Legend Level Bonuses [ In Progress ] 

Article isn't done yet, lol

## New Character Bonuses
Since X-Legend took over AK, the Envoy cube has pretty much been scrapped in favor of giving each character on your account a special type of "box" with goodies for each level up milestone inside. **Here, NW denotes not storable in shared warehouse. ALL items are NT (Not Tradeable)** 

That is, a "Y" for "NW" means you cannot store that item in the shared warehouse. This is to keep you from transferring items between characters, but a lot of items aren't marked this way and so you can get away with moving a lot of stuff.

An underline means that we're looking at a subpackage. Stars are for what I perceive to be the most important.

## Level 30

| Item | Count | NW |
| ---- | ----- | -- |
| Revive Feather | 5 | Y |
| Green Weapon Fort | 10 | Y |
| Green Armor Fort | 20 | Y |
| Crest of Light | 10 | N |
| Auction Card | 25 | N |
| Warehouse Card | 25 | Y |
| Warp Card | 50 | N |
| Hero's Emblem | 1 | N |
| ⭐Proof of Mission | 5 | Y |
| Level 40 Box | 1 | Y | 

The proof of mission is an item that gives you +20\% quest xp for an hour. 

## Level 40

| Item | Count | NW |
| ---- | ----- | -- |
| Revive Feather | 5 | Y |
| Green Weapon Fort | 10 | Y |
| Green Armor Fort | 50 | Y |
| 1,000 Fragments | 5 | N |
| Small Eido Crystals | 10 | N |
| Origin Weapon Exchange Voucher | 1 | Y |
| Proof of Mission | 10 | Y |
| ⭐<u>Advanced Origin Growth Equipment</u> | 1 | Y |
| - ⭐Full Orange (No Core) Aura Armor | | Y |
| ⭐<u>Level 40 Orange Armor Chest</u> | 1 | N |
| - ⭐Full Orange (No Core) Ambusher Armor | | N |
| - ⭐Level 50 Unrefined Armor Chest | | N |
| - ⭐5 Superior Fortification Transfer Scrolls | 5 | N |
| Level 50 Box | 1 | Y |

__Set Bonuses:__
- Ambusher Armor: DMG +5%, DMG to Bosses +15%
- Aura Armor: XP +30%

The Aura Armor's 30% XP bonus is extremely powerful for dungeon leeching. Unfortunately you can't get it on your main account if you made it before migration, since the armor is NW.

The Advanced Origin Growth Equipment is an item that allows you to trade for an orange level 40 weapon with a 10% XP bonus. The weapon is NT, but NOT NW, unlike the coupon that you used to exchange it for. This means you can trade for the main weapon of your alt, and trade it over, and use it to hold a free 10% xp boost (or 20% with sub). 

The Armor Set box will have its own rank progression, giving you a level 50 chest and so on. Most importantly, it gives you 5 superior fortification transfer scrolls, ***which can be brought over to your other accounts!***. This is stupidly overpowered and allows you to essentially farm infinite fort transfer scrolls

## Level 50

| Item | Count | NW |
| ---- | ----- | -- |
| Revive Feather | 5 | Y |
| ⭐7-Day VIP Sprite | 1 | Y |
| Green Weapon Fort | 10 | Y |
| Green Armor Fort | 20 | Y |
| 10k Dragon Points | 1 | N |
| ⭐Proof of Mission | 10 | Y |
| ⭐<u>Level 50 Unrefined Armor Chest</u> | 1 | Y |
| - ⭐Full Orange (No Core) Aria Armor | | N |
| - ⭐Level 60 Unrefined Armor Chest | | N |
| - ⭐5 Superior Fortification Transfer Scrolls | 5 | N |
| Level 60 Box | 1 | Y |

## Summary:
This is basically just a gaia cube replacement. Notable items include the 30% XP bonus from the Aura Armor, the 5 superior fortification transfer scrolls every 10 levels, Proof of Missions, 7-Day VIP Sprite.

I'm kind of miffed about the inability to transfer the Advanced Aura Armor over to the main account. It's a really powerful item that would be great for dungeon leeching, and it gives new players a 20% XP edge for leeching over older players (whose best option is the old blue Aura set, and then transferring the 2 level 40 weapons over). Granted, leeching is a really niche thing, so this honestly shouldn't be very important.
