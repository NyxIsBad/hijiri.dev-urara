None of these envoy paths are necessarily the "best" envoy path, since the meta of the game changes constantly and evolves. This is just one valid sequence for a variety of builds. 

This post is current by 2024-12-19

Paths will be separated into what I believe is necessary and then a possible completion using the free points. You are free to use free points however you wish.

Elements are assumed using the following list: 

- **Duelist:** Physical, weapon element can be ice/holy
- **Guard:** Lightning
- **Ravager:** Flame, weaker alternative: Storm
- **Wizard:** Flame, weaker alternative: Ice
- **Gunslinger:** Storm
- **Grenadier:** Lightning
- **Sorcerer:** Dark = Flame (dark does more in longer fights, flame has higher insta burst)
- **Bard:** Lightning = Storm (Lightning dps, storm longer fights)
- **Brawler/Katar:** Physical, weapon element can be fire
- **Warbow:** Dark, weaker alternative: Holy
- **Ronin/Tachi:** Storm
- **Reaper:** Dark
- **Holy Sword:** Holy, weaker alternative: Lightning, Physical
- **Shuri/Ninja:** Flame = Storm (flame is better generally but storm has a higher insta burst)
- **Lancer:** Dark = Lightning > Flame (Flame is viable only in the endgame)
- **Guitar:** Dark
- **Dragonista/Star Caller:** Lightning, weaker alternative: Holy
- **Whip/Lasher:** Storm
- **Nunchuks/Dragon Trainee:** Ice, weaker alternative: Physical
- **Astro/Stellar Sphere:** Dark = Phys, weaker alternative: Holy

# Duelist

## Envoy Paths
| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Physical | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/duelist?build=111011100111011110000010000000000001111100000000111000010000010) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/duelist?build=111011100111011110000010000000000001111100001000111000010000010) | This is really complicated; built for the dwink build. A point is free if you want to put that somewhere else. |
| Holy | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/duelist?build=011000000111000110000010011000000111111100101000111000010000010) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/duelist?build=011000000111000110000011011000000111111100101000111000010000010) | Note that a point is actually free; most will put it into the 2% DMG tile so that's what I've done, but it can go anywhere. |

Holy is heavily constrained by the fact that we really want the 4 skill tiles on the left, and all grey tiles. Everything else is just a question of how best to get there, so there's not much wiggle room.

Phys is incredibly difficult to write. First of all, the entire top half is fairly fixed. Then, it's a tradeoff; you can only have 3 of the following 4; the 15% CDMG tile, the 25% chance of DoT tile, the 20% Dmg Dealt/Acc tile, and the Swift Somersault zeal tile. I personally believe that you can make up for crit damage in many ways and that it's the least valuable, but I definitely think that the DoT tile can be sacrificed as well due to the short nature of most fights in this game.

# Guardian

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Lightning | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/guardian?build=0000000000000111000000010000000110000001010000010100000110000011111) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/guardian?build=0000000000000111000001110000000110000001110000011100001111110011111) | This is a case where literally anything works. There's no objectively correct answer as long as you pick up the 3 grey tiles. In fact, don't even take my necessary tiles seriously; many of them are just the easiest path to the tiles |

Some people who play tank builds should note that this is for dps; tank builds operate completely differently and are practically inverted. Also, many people choose healing tiles just for QOL reasons because it makes things easier. For instance, this is one [tank possibility](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/guardian?build=0011000011000100100001111000000010111100100000011000000100100011111)

# Ravager

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Flame | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/ravager?build=111101010110001110000011110000010110000000010000000100011110000100) | See Notes | This is a pretty clear cut one to me, but you can connect to the top left through atk cooldown or the 1% dmg tile. |
| Storm | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/ravager?build=111101010111101110000101110000000110000000100000001000011100000100) / [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/ravager?build=110001010000101110000101110000100110111100100000001000011100000100) | See Notes | There's few free tiles here really, just a choice of which direction you want to go |

I prioritize getting the grey tiles a lot for rav because I believe they're more useful than base tiles. However, a build that gives up either Rage or Wild Fury can also work just fine.

# Wizard

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Flame | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/wizard?build=000000000000000000000000000001110000001111000001010001111011111100) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/wizard?build=000001000000010000000010000001110000011111000101110001111011111100) | 6 free points after you get all the necessary fire stuff. I think you might as well get the other elements but up to you! |
| Ice | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/wizard?build=000011000000110000000010000000110000111111001001010010111011110100) | See Notes | The important part is the right gray tile and the upper left. The rest? Honestly you can shuffle things around a bit. |

Wizard is in an odd state because it has some of the most free envoy tiles of any class in the game. I personally believe that wiz benefits from having slightly stronger mobbing skills since using other skills don't interfere with the core dps rotation in the way that dragonista and wings do, for instance.

# Gunslinger

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Storm | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/gunslinger?build=000000000010000000100000000101111000000110000011100000011111110100001) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/gunslinger?build=000000000010000000100000001101111011000110000011100000011111110100101) | It's really just a question of how you want to connect it. 

Yeahh, there's other builds for this as well. You can completely change the method of connecting to the greys. Just make sure you hit all of them as necessary. Also, remember that this is a PVE guide; Gunslinger's PVP ones look totally different.

# Grenadier

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Lightning | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/grenadier?build=000100110000100011111000100001000100001110000001110000001110000110) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/grenadier?build=000100110000100011111000100001000100001110000001110000001110011110) | I honestly prefer MSPD but your 2 free points can go anywhere. It's convenient that we get magnetic optical strafe for free on the left, and the rest is pretty straightforward |

Not much to say here, gren is one of the easiest things here to come up with for me.

# Sorcerer

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Flame | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/sorcerer?build=001011011110000000111111000101111110000001000000010000000000000000000) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/sorcerer?build=001011011110000000111111000101111110011001000001010000000000000000000) | Crazy envoy shape; top and right greys are essential, so is bottom left. 3 free points, you can move the connections around. |
| Dark | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/sorcerer?build=111111100011000000011111000011111110100001000000010000000000000000000) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/sorcerer?build=111111100011000000011111000011111110100001000000010000000100000000000) | 1 free point, Blood Seal for clearing is nice |

Why on earth did X-Legend make the shape like this :deth:

# Bard

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Lightning | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/bard?build=000000000000010000000010000001110001111010010001001100111111000010) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/bard?build=000000000000010000000110000001110001111010010001001100111111110110) | Just pure skill upgrades, 3 free points |
| Storm | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/bard?build=000000000000010000000010000001110001111010010001001100111111000110) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/bard?build=000000000000010000000110000001110001111010010001001100111111110110) | Same as ^ but with 1 less free point |
| Holy | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/bard?build=000000000000010000000010000001110001111010010001001100111111110010) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/bard?build=000000000000010000000110000001110001111010010001001100111111110110) | Wow that's crazy |

Bard is a funny class. You can play a lot of elements, including holy! (even if it's much weaker than lightning or storm)

But because of the uniformity of the envoy path, they end up looking pretty much the same. In fact, because of how close the element specific tiles are to the main path, its just nice to pick them up anyway no matter what element you are.

# Brawler/Katar

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Physical | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/brawler?build=001000000010000001111000011101000000000000010000100100011110000011110) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/brawler?build=001000000010000001111000011111000001110000010000100100011110000011110) | Note that this requires going through a combo skill tile. It's annoying but I think it's worth having 15% cdmg over the eva. |

A pretty straightforward one, you can put the 4 free tiles anywhere but I think straight DMG is always foolproof.

# Warbow

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Dark | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/ranger?build=000011010011010111100010100000111000010010000000010000000011110010) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/ranger?build=000011010011010111100010100000111000010010000010010000000011110011) | 2 free tiles, only get domineering thunder if you're a bard sub | 

Soon to be outdated due to the rework. Holy is weak enough that I'm not going to post it here, but feel free to DM me on discord if you want an alternative. Domineering Thunder is a rare case of a combo skill worth getting because of just how many iframes this one gives. You can also do frost arrow. 

# Ronin/Tachi

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Storm | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/ronin?build=001111111101000000100000001111000010000001000000001000000011111111000) | See Notes | There's not really a better build here imo. 0 free points | 

# Reaper

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Dark | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/reaper?build=001110100110111001000000110000001111000011100000100000000000000000000) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/reaper?build=001110100111111001110011110000001111000011100000100000000000000000000) | The bottom grey is kind of not that useful; if you are a shuri sub consider going through windwalk instead because its a great skill. |

# Holy Sword

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Holy | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/holy-sword?build=001110000011110000011000000100000000100000001100000000110000000000) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/holy-sword?build=011110000111110111111000001111100000100000001100000000110000000000) | You can do this a lot of ways. |
| Lightning | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/holy-sword?build=001000000011100111111000000100000000100000001110001000111111100000) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/holy-sword?build=011000000111100111111000000100000000100000001110001000111111100000) | Pick up the phys skill bonus cause why not. Once again, you can do this a lot of ways. You could for instance go through the HP on the left instead of the spd/eva tiles |
| Physical | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/holy-sword?build=011000000111110111111000000111100000100000001100000000110000000000) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/holy-sword?build=011000000111110111111000000111100000111000001110000000110000000000) | Crit harder, the game |

# Shuriken/Ninja

| Storm | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/shinobi?build=000000000010000000110000000111011110111000010010000101111011000) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/shinobi?build=000000000010000000110000000111011110111000010110000111111011100) | Crit and SPD galore |

| Flame | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/lancer?build=000010011000111000010100001001110111010000010010000010110000110011) | See Notes | It's hard to really do this better; you could give up a lance dmg tile for the bottom left max cdmg tile (but realistically using Agni's should help you on that and any higher is always diminishing returns) |

# Guitar

# Whip/Lasher

| Element | Necessary Tiles | Full Build | Notes |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Storm | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/whip?build=000011000000010000000100000001100000011111000000001000000111000010) | [Build](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/envoy/whip?build=000011100000010000000100000001100000011111001100011001011111110010) | Goes for dmg, the bottom left grey, and also a little bit of crit rate.
