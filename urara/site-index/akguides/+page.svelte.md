### Guide Posts (ordered by date descending)

1. [X-Legend Leveling Rewards](./levelingrewards/)
   - A summary of the rewards you receive from the gaia boxes (does not include what you get from envoy cube) because AKDB doesn't show it
2. [Dungeon Lag Fix](./dungeonlagfix/)
   - A fix for lag you get in certain instances
3. [Food Shop & Reference](./shop)
   - Both prices for buying food from me, and a comprehensive list of every food and drink in the game above level 80
4. [Guild Instance Guide](./guild-instances/)
   - A guide on how to complete the weekly guild instances
5. [WIP Dictionary](./dictionary/)

6. [WIP (don't use this rn lol) Gear Guide](./gearguide/)
   - List of optimal gears for every major level unlock stage, along with reasoning for *why* they are the best.
   - This guide is not concise. If you want a short list of what's simply best (albeit authored and opinioned by others), try the `AK.TO References -> Gear` sheet below. It will be translated very differently from AKUS, but you should be able to get the gist of it.

### External Links

<u>Disclaimer for all resources for AK.TO:</u> As this is a private server guide for a different version of the game, translations WILL BE DIFFERENT! This may be unreadable at times as a result. The guide was not made to work for AKUS, and don't bother the writers of the guides because it doesn't work for AKUS.
