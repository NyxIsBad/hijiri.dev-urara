# Intro

This is a set of recommendations for gear at each major stage of the game. I'll cite my reasons for some sets and why I dq'd others. It will be subdivided into sections for Gear, and Food per level. Additionally, I will be subdividing gear sections into

- **Low End:** Starter gear, for your first time at that instance and if you don't really have the most money. This is not meta, but is easy to get and very cheap to make (and is sufficient for on level instances)
- **Mid End:** Mid level gear for if you have more money and can afford to create stronger gear. Use these recommendations if you want to be stronger.
- **High End:** The Best In Slot (BIS) items for anything. These items *can* be very, very expensive. This slot may contain P2W items or items that are impractical to get without a huge amount of accumulation.

### Just Disclaimers
- EVERYTHING IS IMO. There are other ways to play the game.
- Many of the decisions are class blind. I try to specify when something will be build/class specific, but that doesn't mean that this will be end-all be-all accurate for every dps class.
- This post was made 2024-06-15 and covers the situation of gear in AK at this time. This means that some of the info may become outdated over time.
- This post is PVE targeted. This means I won't be covering PVP sets. I think that PVP sets are pretty easily optimized because there's really only like 3 sets, and enchantment cards for costumes are also very linear. 
- I make a few assumptions and cases regarding your permastats (eg from achievements, and archive) throughout. This means that some of the recommendations may not be optimal for you. I will try to specify which ones will.
- I intentionally avoid Anima Crystals. There's literally about a billion of them in the game, and which one is best is extremely class and context specific. In general, the gold ones are better.
- I also avoid books (aura manuals). They are not necessarily a gear item that's "built", and are frequently prohibitively expensive. I run damage calculations without taking them into account.

### Knowledge :tm:
- This game values certain stats far more than others. Irregardless of class, AK is a game that values dps output. **With the exception of Guardian after rework, which will scale on DEF** and can ignore parts of this guide, and **full support Bard builds**, all other classes should prioritize DPS output.
- There are 2 great places in the game for testing your gear. There's a [training dummy](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/npc/47941-wood-pile-for-training) in **<u>Acadian (197,121)</u>**, which can be debuffed but will die (it has 2 billion HP). The second one is an [immortal totem](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/npc/40227-corpser-totem) in **<u>Candeo Marsh (683,190)</u>** which can't be debuffed but is good for testing your own combat procs.
- If you're interested in a lot of the theory behind the gear, check out [Lind's Optimization Theory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-M2polFzj3pV454YmjxTUDkkX6pY1-72HnwiTJgOw8/edit?usp=sharing). It provides a lot of basic ideas for how damage is calculated in this game. While the formulas are not precise and exclude coefficients, it is in essence how we optimize gear.
- Two types of elemental cores in gear matter.
  - For weapons, the element of the weapon grants 20% elemental damage for that element, only for skills fired by that weapon. Thus, prioritize whatever elements are meta for your class (and more specifically your build).
  - For armor, the element of the chestpiece grants elemental damage reduction against that element. This makes the core of the chestpiece much more irrelevant in comparison, but with the knowledge that most bosses in the game are dark, you should prefer dark.
- When crafting green into orange, the closer the % of the green item is to max (120%), the higher the chance is that the orange armor will have a higher percentage. It is not a guarantee but I would suggest you use 120% greens or close to maximize your chance of not having to reroll.
- Rerolling armor percentages is mostly redundant because it grants only small amounts of Def. However, rerolling weapons is a must. 

# Masteries

Acquiring a gold mastery may be somewhat difficult. Some of these golds can be bought from the DP store using Eternia, but others are just rng drops. Orange is mostly fine though.

- **<u>General Skills:</u>** This is meant to be a class specific mastery. Choose something that's best for your class, typically a dmg% or def shred skill.
- **<u>Attack Spec:</u>** This is always [Gold Zeal](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/28016-lecture-on-zeal). It is essentially a flat +11% damage boost due to how zeal works in this game.
- **<u>Advanced Skills:</u>** This will also be class specific.
- **<u>Defense Spec:</u>** This spec rarely matters for DPS output. Most people use [Extreme Speed](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/28048-lecture-on-extreme-speed). Iron Wall may be used if you need Def that bad, but we prefer to use The Best Defense in Special Skills.
- **<u>Tactical Spec:</u>** This is typically [Break Defense](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/28056-lecture-on-break-defense). The relatively new "Element Wave" masteries are also very good though, especially because everyone and their last 3 generations of ancestors are using Break Defense in your party anyway (and it doesn't stack)
- **<u>Special Skills:</u>** For newer players, use [The Best Defense](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/28411-lecture-on-the-best-defense). Given that you scale dmg pretty hard, this is a one stop shop for capping defense. If you are stronger, use [Deep Blue](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/28417-lecture-on-deep-blue), a 5% dmg boost. Late game players also use Capoeira or Omniscience to get overcap stats.

# Holy Chest

This one is simple. I suggest using one of the weapons from each abyss (Nazrudin, Yarnaros, Zaahir, Quelkulan) and then stack +DMG to Dark% (you can throw in a few others if you want, but try to focus on dark) bonuses. Most bosses in the game are dark.

AHC is not something that is "built", so I ignore it. If you want to know what is optimal to sacrifice, check out my [calculator sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12VrRiIP0SYDZVBeT1wFezqMmhtLXvo5Ukb6gn2resv4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) on it.

# Weapon Mastery

You receive **140 points TOTAL** from 70 levels in either path. In general, the last 20 points can be fairly difficult to get before s1. You'll get these over time. The following are listed in order of priority:

- 20 points in Crit Dmg
- 30 points in Dmg
- 15 points in Accuracy (this can be class dependent - Dragonista procs huge acc from Envoy)

That makes up 65 points. Accuracy may be contentious at later levels, but is absolutely important for a long time (probably up to s20).

 Most players will elect to put at least 15 into MSPD, and you should highly prioritize the 20 points put into Dmg to Dark bosses, since they are the most common boss type in the game. Elemental Resist is decent for survival if you are lacking in that.

The rest is up to you to make up for deficiencies in your build (for instance, I like to put points into Crit because it tends to be nerfed below the cap in instances for me, but late game players may want to put into SPD for higher overcap Zeal chance).

# Costumes

All you really need is orange costumes. You may not have the gold capital to get the costumes you want yet. Depending on how much DP you have, buy the Blue cards from the DP shop, and you can buy Premium enchantments from LP. 

It is <u>REALLY</u> important that, if you are using a gold card, you apply *both* enchantment cards by first enchanting the blue card with the gold card, and then the costume with the blue card.

Super & Abyss costume cards are typically relegated to para only drops. Super cards tend to be much more common than Abyss cards though, and are consequently much more affordable. On the other hand, the laughably easy accessibility of Premium cards (via the LP shop) makes them trivial to obtain and frequently are "good enough". Many simply try to go from Premium to Abyss.

# Level 1-79

### Gear

The first 80 levels are considered the "tutorial" levels of the game. While in the past the xp curve was much harder, with the addition of s levels up to 35, these are now really trivial and are thus not worth using gold on. Use the gear acquired from the [leveling rewards](../levelingrewards/) to get through these levels. 

The Advanced Aura gear is quite nice until it hits it's scaling level cap. 

Remember to use proof of missions, and happy questing.

It does not need to be fortified to get through them, although you may choose to do so now that fortification transfer scrolls are free.

### Consumables

If this is your first character, you will also have received a Gaia Cube. This will also award you gear, along with some food.

# Level 80-89

**Summary:** Your gear is still not very relevant, due to the tutorial esque setting of main questing. However, it's the first point where you have the chance to make "real gear".

### Gear

**Weapon**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| Level 85 Gold - Incredibly easy to acquire because it's free from DP book. | Level 80 Ghodroon Weapon - Blacksmithing, but also received for free from envoy cube. | N/A |
| SUB: Blue Noct | SUB: Blue Noct | SUB: Level 80 Ghodroon Weapon (Blacksmithing)

**Note:** Gold weapon bonuses are not consistent. Some gold weapons are not particularly good! Look carefully at the class specific weapon you have to decide if it's better than orange.

At this point of the game, you don't need to care too much about cores or on element. In reality, none of these weapons are particularly hard to get, and almost anything will work. 

For the sub weapon, find a Nocturnal blue weapon by searching "Precious Chests" that drop from mobs in instances every so often. You can find a gold sub or make an orange if you want, but once again... it really doesn't matter. Fortifying your weapon also shouldn't matter much here.

**Top Armor**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| N/A | [Level 80 Lordswrath](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/16388-lordswrath-hat) - Received for free from envoy cube. Keep this so you can give it to your alts later, because you do not receive level 80 gear from the gaia boxes. | N/A |
  - At a time where you have no scaling stats, 30% crit damage to bosses helps fill up your crit damage cap. 10% raw dmg is also a really significant multiplier when you have almost no other raw dmg stats.
  - For enchantment cards, simply use whatever you have. Level 80 cards aren't particularly good, and are honestly kind of difficult to get. You shouldn't really need it.

**Bottom Armor**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| N/A | [Level 80 Lordswrath](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/16392-lordswrath-belt) - Once again, received for free. | N/A |
  - Simply a stronger version of the top set, with 12% dmg and 35% crit damage. 
  - For enchantment cards, simply use whatever you have.

**Trophy**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| [Lost Bewitching Bones](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/16506-lost-bewitching-bones) | [Level 70 Guzigla's Bloodied Tooth](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/14965-guziglas-bloodied-tooth) - provides 11% d-dmg. | N/A |
| [Lost Memory Rune](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/16508-lost-memory-rune) | [Level 85 Zahr-Kazaal's Icy Spine](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17459-zahr-kazaals-icy-spine) - provides an early source of defense shred. | N/A |

In reality, any other trophy can work here. Level 80 is a time when you are not gated by anything.

**Accessories**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| Anything | [Fallen Apostle's Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17845-rabisus-crystal-of-symbiosis). Can be bought from the DP shop without needing ST crests unlike the next one. | N/A |
| Anything | [Lost Memories Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17311-vickis-love). Must be acquired from ST or use 20 ST sigils to get. | N/A |

- Fallen Apostle: This provides 8% damage taken. Most importantly, it's free! With no side currency required! 
- Lost Memories: You'll need at least 75 ST sigils later to buy Agni's at SLv5. If you think it will take you a really long time to get to S5 and have the sigils to spare, you can get this.
  - A shockingly powerful 40% def shred. You don't get anywhere close to this even at much higher levels. However, there is a 50% cap on % based def shred.

**Mount**

- Elemental damage % will always be the best until later.

**Secret Stones**
- Buy secret stones for armor from the shop that are in accordance with your class. You will upgrade them to purple later.
- For your weapon, buy Lava Secret Stones. They can be dropped from Pyroclastic Purgatory or just bought from AH. 

**Emblem**
- Use anything. Try to get elemental damage if possible on a gold emblem.

### Consumables

**Food:** [Dreamy Heaven](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18137-dreamy-heaven) provides triple strike and significant damage.

**Drink:** [Golden Latte](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18157-golden-latte) provides 12% detail damage (not dmg, that's a mistl)

# Level 90-99

**Summary:** Make full gear, including weapon, top/bottom armor, trophies, and accessories. This is the foundation for your awakening levels. Make sure you're not missing a decent mount or secret stones.

The first phase where fortifying and creating armor is mandatory to some extent. Marked by preparing for Awakening, you must have fairly powerful gear to cross the gear check. While you can skip meta gear and forts with the LP awakening method, this results in you being very weak in the early S levels. I highly suggest you craft level 90 gear. 

This is because, if you do decide to skip 90 gear, you may find yourself forced to create s1 forest gear. However, forest gear is relatively weak for orange armor, and the first decent gold armors do not appear until s5.

### Gear

**Weapon**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| (+20) Level 95 Gold - DP book | (+20) Level 95 Gold - DP book | (+30) Level 90 Nalani Weapon - Blacksmithing |
| N/A | (+20) Level 90 Nalani Weapon - Blacksmithing | N/A |
| SUB: (+10) Blue Nocturnal | SUB: (+20) Level 90 Nocturnal Nalani - Blacksmithing | SUB: (+30) Level 90 Nocturnal Nalani - Blacksmithing

**Note:** Gold weapon bonuses are not consistent. Some gold weapons are not particularly good! Look carefully at the class specific weapon you have to decide if it's better than orange.


- Gold Weapon: A strong case for gold weapons is the ability to dump them into Holy Chest afterwards. They're also really cheap.
  - +20 at least, Use level 90 weapon cards for DMG or CDMG.
  - Ensure that it is on element. This gives you a 20% elemental damage boost for that element.
- Nalani Weapon: Almost always more powerful. For main weapon, try to get a Destroyer core as meta. Lower tier cores are acceptable, especially Deadly or Fell because you're likely lacking in Crit Damage or Accuracy at this time.
  - Ensure that it is on element. This gives you a 20% elemental damage boost for that element.
  - +20, Use level 90 weapon cards for DMG or CDMG.
- Level 90 Nocturnal Nalani Weapon - Blacksmithing
  - If you have a level 80 orange noct weapon, you may choose to skip this. 
  - +20, Use level 90 weapon cards for DMG or CDMG.

**Top Armor**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| N/A | (+20) [Level 90 Holy Chant](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17990-holy-spirits-hat-of-the-blazing-night) - Blacksmithing, also known as Holy Spirit | (+30) [Level 90 Holy Chant](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17990-holy-spirits-hat-of-the-blazing-night) - Blacksmithing, also known as Holy Spirit |

- Holy Chant: This set is a necessity, even for poorer players, as it's the first real set you will ever make. You also receive this for free from the Envoy cube, which is awfully convenient.
  - 12% detail damage dealt and 35% cdmg is the most powerful orange core set you can have.
  - +20 the set and use level 90 enchantment cards.
  - This is definitively better than the Magic Sundering top set! It gives 4% more detail damage. 

**Bottom Armor**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| N/A | (+20) [Level 90 Abyssal Naught](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18009-magic-sundering-belt-of-the-abyss) - Blacksmithing, also known as Magic Sundering set. | (+30) [Level 90 Holy Anthem](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17994-holy-spirits-belt-of-the-blazing-night) - Blacksmithing, also known as Holy Spirit set | 
| N/A | (+20) [Level 90 Holy Anthem](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17994-holy-spirits-belt-of-the-blazing-night) - Blacksmithing, also known as Holy Spirit set | (+30) [Level 90 Abyssal Naught](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18009-magic-sundering-belt-of-the-abyss) - Blacksmithing, also known as Magic Sundering set. |

- A comparison of Holy Anthem and Abyssal Naught set:
  - Abyssal Naught grants 10% dmg% and a 15% chance to proc 10% crit, 20% cdmg. 
  - Holy Anthem gives 12% dmg% and 40% cdmg to bosses. 
  - Abyssal Naught is a lot easier to get, because it's dropped from the envoy cube. However, Holy Anthem is technically strictly better 
  - I claim that Abyssal Naught (or Magic Sundering) is better for mid end players because you get it for free from the envoy cube. It's clearly worse, but not having to pay for smithing is a huge plus for people trying to be a little economical.
  - A strong argument for Holy Anthem is that most players will skip s1 gear and even retain it for s5-s10. This means that many players will keep their bottom sets past the point where they build Agni's so the extra cdmg is actually highly relevant even when other cdmg sources come in and you cap.

**Trophy**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| (+20) [Level 70 Guzigla's Bloodied Tooth](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/14965-guziglas-bloodied-tooth) | (+20) [Level 95 Cultural Relic](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/items?q%5Bs%5D=min_lvl_nl+desc&q%5Bname_cont%5D=Cultural+Relic&q%5Btype_id_eq%5D=1039) | (+30) [Level 95 Cultural Relic](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/items?q%5Bs%5D=min_lvl_nl+desc&q%5Bname_cont%5D=Cultural+Relic&q%5Btype_id_eq%5D=1039) | 
| (+20) [Level 85 Zahr-Kazaal's Icy Spine](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17459-zahr-kazaals-icy-spine) | (+20) [Level 95 Dabaka's](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20213-dabakas-makeshift-contraption) | (+30) [Level 95 Dabaka's](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20213-dabakas-makeshift-contraption) |
| N/A | (+20) [Level 95 Delfonia's Exquisite Earrings](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18321-delfonias-exquisite-earrings) | (+30) [Level 95 Delfonia's Exquisite Earrings](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18321-delfonias-exquisite-earrings) |

- [Level 95 Cultural Relic](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/items?q%5Bs%5D=min_lvl_nl+desc&q%5Bname_cont%5D=Cultural+Relic&q%5Btype_id_eq%5D=1039)
  - By far one of the best trophies in the game. You can keep this until s35, so +20 it at least for now and +30 over time.
- [Level 95 Dabaka's](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20213-dabakas-makeshift-contraption)
  - Defense shred. +20 it. This is second BIS because of the flat def shred. The 50% def shred cap means that this can be useful during a time where an unreliable proc from Delfonia's may not be ideal
- [Level 95 Delfonia's Exquisite Earrings](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18321-delfonias-exquisite-earrings)
  - A +35% dmg on next attack trophy. It's very strong, however requires 10% chance on a crit (which should be 100% of the time) and can occur at most every other attack.
- [Level 70 Guzigla's Bloodied Tooth](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/14965-guziglas-bloodied-tooth)
  - Provides 11% d-dmg. Carryover from level 80.
- [Level 85 Zahr-Kazaal's Icy Spine](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17459-zahr-kazaals-icy-spine)
  - Provides an early source of defense shred. Carryover from level 80.
- Any other damage taken/def shred trophy is also theoretically fine

**Accessories**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| N/A | (+20) [Level 95 Wild Howl](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20228-ladias-alchemy) - DP book | (+30) [Level 95 Wild Howl](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20228-ladias-alchemy) - DP book |

- Wild Howl: A gold set acquirable for 9k gdp from the DP book or by searching Hall of Philae. 
  - By far the only viable meta set because of the Bewildered status. This grants 30% Crit Damage, and 50% Max Crit Damage. This can be used until you acquire Agni's.

**Mount**
- Use a **Level 4** Elemental Dmg % mount (or whatever is highest level at the time of reading).

**Secret Stones**
- Buy secret stones for armor from the shop that are in accordance with your class. UPGRADE THEM TO PURPLE by leveling it to level 70, and then using 10 rainbow stones! From now on, I will assume you have purple stones.
- For your weapon, buy Lava Secret Stones. They can be dropped from Pyroclastic Purgatory or just bought from AH. 
  - Reroll using reroll pots to get dmg%. Aim for the highest percent possible with current pots. dmg% rerolls (with the exception of 7% on lava main) are actually detail damage, which is an important scaling stat.

**Emblem**
- Use elemental damage if possible on a gold emblem.

### Consumables

**Food:** 
- [Cheesy Tomato Ciabatta](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19099-cheesy-tomato-ciabatta) provides MSPD and XP%
- [Creamy Chicken Pie](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19270-creamy-chicken-pie) provides triple strike

**Drink:**
- [Petal Water](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19282-petal-water) provides Mounted MSPD and XP%
- [Golden Latte](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18157-golden-latte) provides 12% detail damage (not dmg, that's a mistl)

# Level S1-S4

**Summary:** Not much needs to be upgraded here other than optional upgrades to weapon, and one of your trophies. You should be consolidating your gear from the 90s. Scoop up a random Holy Spirit (the new gear slot).

Welcome to the s levels! The early awakening levels are marked by a lack of gear improvement. The unlocked gear is not good enough (in fact, sometimes worse) to justify immediate upgrades if you have sufficiently powerful level 90 gear. Most players who don't have significant gold reserves will be coming off of spending on level 90 gear, especially given how fast the level 90 phase is. Consequently, many elect to skip this phase entirely and build at s5.

### Gear

**Note:** Gold weapon bonuses are not consistent. Some gold weapons are not particularly good! Look carefully at the class specific weapon you have to decide if it's better than orange. 

At this point in time, pen becomes a dominant scaling statistic. This narrows the gap between gold and orange in theory, because the real stats matter much less than how much pen it grants. s1-s5 is a very short period of time with XP curve reworks. You no longer need much power to get through, so keeping your level 90 weapon is a very viable strategy. If you're rich, you may choose to make new gear. However, I believe that no one is getting stat checked too hard as long as they have +25 or +30 level 90 weapons.

Most players will choose to skip this step entirely and wait until s5 to build again.

- If you do use s1 gear, this provides you with an extra 2% pen at least. Use the highest level enchantment cards you can.

- A comparison of the Holy Chant and Forest Wound sets:
  - The Holy Chant set gives 12% detail damage dealt and 35% cdmg is the most powerful orange core set you can have at level 90. This means you use level 90 cards.
  - Forest Wound set gives 12% detail damage, 35% cdmg
  - Note that the set bonus is not better! The advantage from crafting s1 is an extra 2% penetration from higher level cards. However, the cost of acquiring cores/recipes/etc can make this very unlikely to be worth it if you're not rich. That money may be better spent fortifying armor or preparing for s5+.
  - This is the reason why I only recommend crafting Forest armor for very rich people - you would craft this exclusively for raw stats/2% pen ;D

  - By far one of the best trophies in the game. Keep working on +30ing it. Use if you don't use Bond. This is better due to the 20% attribute damage, and is especially good if you are a dark class. Elemental damage can sometimes be hard to come by, and you need to keep it's scaling up to par with the other elements of the dps formula

  - A decent def shred crafted trophy. +20 it. Use if you don't use Bond and have some money.
  - Def shred becomes really powerful after a certain point. Reducing a mob's defense value from .8 to .75 (by just 6%) is enough to 1.5x your damage under certain circumstances.
- [Level 95 Dabaka's](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20213-dabakas-makeshift-contraption)

- [Level 95 Delfonia's Exquisite Earrings](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18321-delfonias-exquisite-earrings)

  - There are multiple bond sets. The [Flower Sprite](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/32880-bond-eternal-sorrow) set is likely the best set that's accessible, but the [Otherworld Link](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/32888-bond-cyclone-link) set is theoretically not bad either. 
- P2W sets (Genki Skyforged Set, Time & Destiny Set)
  - Probably worth hundreds of thousands of gold. Clearly better but literally only use it if you're 1.) an alt 2.) rich as heck. I think that which one is better is technical and build specific, but generally Time & Destiny set should be better in most situations.

In general, `P2W > Bond > Relic + Souler`, assuming you have the damage to support bond being better than relic.

- Wild Howl: A gold set acquirable for 9k gdp from the DP book or by searching Hall of Philae. 
  - By far the only viable meta set because of the Bewildered status. This grants 30% Crit Damage, and 50% Max Crit Damage. This can be used until you acquire Agni's.

**Mount**
- Use a Level 4 Elemental Dmg % mount (or whatever is highest level).
- You might want to start acquiring an Almighty mount. You may need it at later levels. They tend to be much more expensive than ele%, but can be useful to help cap stats when instances start nerfing you really hard.

**Secret Stones**
- Weapon - Lava Secret Stones
- Armor - Purple Secret Stones (upgraded from Orange)
- Reroll using reroll pots to get dmg%. Aim for the highest percent possible with current pots. dmg% rerolls (with the exception of 7% on lava main) are actually detail damage, which is an important scaling stat.

**Emblem**
- Highest ELE% possible on an emblem. Goes up to 8+17=25%. You should be using one of the special types (eg Darkshadow Gaia Emblem) which guarantee the 8%.
- You can choose to work on other stats as well at this point, but elemental damage will *always* be the main objective for emblems.
- If you're rich, you should buy one of the Eido Blessing emblems, or the ones with the fancy swirly pentagon logos like [War Roar](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/33339-war-roar-emblem), or [Mistress of Moonshadow](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/23752-mistress-of-moonshadow-emblem).

**Holy Spirit**

A new armor slot unlocked by being in awakening levels.

- [Golden Horn](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/21612-golden-horn)
  - Provides def shred. It's my opinion that this is better, because you should really have cap crit (even accounting for instance nerfs) at this level if you take into consideration other crit sources. Additionally, it's a decent amount of flat def shred (2.5k of it almost) over the % cap.
- [Night Owl Arrow](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/21613-night-owl-arrow)
  - Provides 10% crit rate. Clearly still decent, especially if you're crit capped. 

These items can be rerolled. Focus on getting good stats like dmg to dark, crit damage, etc that you're lacking.

# Level S5-S9

**Summary:** YOU MUST GET AGNI'S! Upgrade weapon if you like golds, with optional upgrades to top armor and a trophy. Continue consolidating your old gear.

A phase of intermediate gear improvement. At this point, you should be +30ing your main weapon because of the considerable stat bonuses that the +30 stage bonuses bring. You should not be leveling so fast that you will replace it in a short time.

### Gear

**Note:** Gold weapon bonuses are not consistent. Some gold weapons are not particularly good! Look carefully at the class specific weapon you have to decide if it's better than orange.

Weapons will continue to change relatively slowly. Orange continues to be consistently better, but the s5 gold weapon is always a not-totally-terrible option, and can bring a much needed pen boost. Many players (including me) tend to just upgrade to each gold weapon in order after this point (s5 -> s15 -> s25 ...)

However, if you are very highly built eidolon archive wise, be careful of overcapping on crit damage! You may only use as much crit damage as you have cap, and orange weapons are great primarily because of their CDMG to bosses (which counts towards the cap).

  - Forest Wound set gives 12% detail damage, 35% cdmg
  - Note that the set bonus is not better! The advantage from crafting s1 is an extra 2% penetration from higher level cards. However, the cost of acquiring cores/recipes/etc can make this very unlikely to be worth it if you're not rich. That money may be better spent fortifying armor or preparing for s5+.
  - This is the reason why I only recommend crafting Forest armor for very rich people - you would craft this exclusively for raw stats/2% pen ;D
- [S5 Gazing Time](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19744-eternias-time-travel-hat) - This is a free set, which is super nice. Because you can exchange for tons of copies of this from VOE (which you should have been running), you can also easily get this to a very high star for free. Use LP to get each to 3 stars, then combine those.
  - Provides 10% dmg%, 10% detail damage to all elements. 
  - This upgrade loses you all of the cdmg from holy chant, along with 2% d-dmg, BUT: Allows you to use s1 enchant cards (eg more pen) and higher base stats. This makes it a compelling upgrade for those at s5 who need a minor power boost, while being almost completely free.

- [S5 Fading Time Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19748-eternias-destiny-girdle)
  - This set is not recommended because of how much you lose. The set grants 10% crit rate, 20% cdmg, and 6% zeal chance. Magic Sundering has a significantly stronger set bonus. Although you could theoretically upgrade to this if you met the conditions of 1.) sufficient Crit & CDMG from external sources 2.) Need Pen, this case is *really* rare.
  - The zeal chance can be really funny if you proc it though, and it *is* free, so it's really up to you. I leave to you the fact that it gives you no raw dps output according to dmg calc, except in very specific situations.

**Trophy**

Very little changes here, with the exception of Fatima's Thunder Boost becoming technically better than Souler. However, this being worth building is rare due to the fort costs.

  - This is better than Souler because of the CDMG. However, building a new gold trophy may be questionable.
- [S1 Souler - Deadly Ice Ring](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19588-souler-deadly-ice-ring)

| N/A | N/A | (+30) [S5 Demonic Release](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20646-crown-of-agni) - DP book, EST, commonly known as Agni's Set. |

- [S5 Demonic Release (Agni's)](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20646-crown-of-agni): BY FAR the best vanilla set in the game. It can be exchanged for with 15k GDP and 25 sky tower sigils per piece (so 45k GDP and 75 sigils total)
  - Provides an 8% chance to give 150% cdmg cap.
  - This is *really important*. Players have a huge amount of crit damage sources, but typically only 300% base cdmg cap. You can get another 80-100 from various sources but >~400% cdmg cap is nowhere near enough to account for the 500+ that most players end up getting. Agni's is thus, for almost all high level players in almost all situations, essentially a 150% crit damage buff.
- [Level 95 Wild Howl](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20228-ladias-alchemy):
  - If you do not have the crit damage to overcap your crit damage by at least 50%, wild howl is still likely better for you to *use*. However, this is typically not an excuse to not build agni's. You can continue using this, but build agni's on the side.
- [Heavenly Seal](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/47015-path-of-inquiry-soul-chain): 
  - Putting this on here is unironically a joke because you actually need the Abyss set in order to get the Heavenly Seal set (and more!). It's strictly an upgrade to Abyss, but is literally impossible to get because you need a formula that's *also* para only.
  - Provides (if you include procs) 48% cdmg, 52% d-dmg, 20% mspd, 40 armor piercing, 20% pen, 20% attribute d-dmg, 50% def shred, 150% cdmg cap, 30% skill d-dmg, 20% almighty nerf. 
- [Abyss Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/46790-abyss-soul-shackles)
  - An extremely powerful set that provides tons of base stats, pen/armor piercing/mspd, crit damage cap (and is consequently a strictly better upgrade than Agni's), tons of detail damage from/to elements, and 2 very powerful debuffs.
  - However, it's para only and are really expensive to get. There is demand for it but frequently no market.

**Mount**
- Use a Level 4 Elemental Dmg % mount (or whatever is highest level).
- You might want to start acquiring an Almighty mount. You may need it at later levels. They tend to be much more expensive than ele%, but can be useful to help cap stats when instances start nerfing you really hard.

**Secret Stones**
- Weapon - Lava Secret Stones
- Armor - Purple Secret Stones (upgraded from Orange)
- Reroll using reroll pots to get dmg%. Aim for the highest percent possible with current pots. dmg% rerolls (with the exception of 7% on lava main) are actually detail damage, which is an important scaling stat.

**Emblem**
- Highest ELE% possible on an emblem. Goes up to 8+17=25%. You should be using one of the special types (eg Darkshadow Gaia Emblem) which guarantee the 8%.
- You can choose to work on other stats as well at this point, but elemental damage will *always* be the main objective for emblems.
- If you're rich, you should buy one of the Eido Blessing emblems, or the ones with the fancy swirly pentagon logos like [War Roar](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/33339-war-roar-emblem), or [Mistress of Moonshadow](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/23752-mistress-of-moonshadow-emblem).

A new armor slot unlocked by being in awakening levels. All Holy Spirits are acquired from DT, with the exception of the gold upgrades which are unlocked from combining the former orange and a recipe dropped from nightmare dungeons. This means that you need to either run DT or buy the item from someone else.

- [Golden Horn](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/21612-golden-horn)
  - Provides def shred. It's my opinion that this is better, because you should really have cap crit (even accounting for instance nerfs) at this level if you take into consideration other crit sources. Additionally, it's a decent amount of flat def shred (2.5k of it almost) over the % cap.
- [Night Owl Arrow](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/21613-night-owl-arrow)
  - Provides 10% crit rate. Clearly still decent, especially if you're crit capped. 

These items can be rerolled. Focus on getting good stats like dmg to dark, crit damage, etc that you're lacking.

# Level S10-S14 

WORKING ON THIS PART:

**Summary:** Upgrading armor should be a very serious consideration. Optional upgrade to weapon, lots of new consumable unlocks, almost mandatory trophy upgrade.

As leveling starts to slow down, we gain access to much better (and much more expensive) armor and trophies as soon as we hit s10. Because of how much slower leveling is at this point, you will be using this gear for a long time - and thus may want to invest in it. 

### Gear

**Weapon**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| (+20) S5 Gold - DP book | (+25~30) S5 Gold - DP book | (+30) S10 Evil God Weapon - Blacksmithing |
| N/A | (+25~30) S10 Evil God Weapon - Blacksmithing | (+30) S5 Gold - DP book |
| N/A | SUB: (+20) S10 Nocturnal Evil God - Blacksmithing | SUB: (+30) S10 Nocturnal Evil God - Blacksmithing |

**Note:** Gold weapon bonuses are not consistent. Some gold weapons are not particularly good! Look carefully at the class specific weapon you have to decide if it's better than orange.

At this point, if you are still using your level 90 weapon for a sub, you should really upgrade to s10. It will provide you with a huge bonus amount of pen and raw stats. Given how long you will have this, it's almost certainly a good idea to have the highest level orange.

**Top Armor**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| (+20) [S10 Evil Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20899-evil-conqueror-helmet) - Blacksmithing, also known as Evil Conqueror set. | (+20~30) [S10 Evil Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20899-evil-conqueror-helmet) - Blacksmithing, also known as Evil Conqueror set. | (+30) [S10 Evil Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20899-evil-conqueror-helmet) - Blacksmithing, also known as Evil Conqueror set. |
| N/A | (+20~30) [S5 Gazing Time](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19744-eternias-time-travel-hat) - VOE, also known as Eternia Set | N/A |

- [S10 Evil Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20899-evil-conqueror-helmet) - At this point, this becomes a little expensive just to craft. Make sure you are getting a core that is at least half decent. Ensure that the armor is dark core if possible to take advantage of the elemental reduction.
  - Provides 15% detail damage, 35% crit damage to bosses. It is strictly better than s5 eternia, and the only reason why you'd stick with eternia is if you wanted to be a little cheap about gear upgrades. 
  - Both Guardian Knight and Ninja sets (the other orange sets) are not strictly offensive, with Ninja providing p-heal and Guardian Knight being a defensive set. Thus, this is clearly the best.
- [S5 Gazing Time](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19744-eternias-time-travel-hat) - This is a free set, which is super nice. Because you can exchange for tons of copies of this from VOE (which you should have been running), you can also easily get this to a very high star for free. Use LP to get each to 3 stars, then combine those.
  - Provides 10% dmg%, 10% detail damage to all elements. 
  - This upgrade loses you all of the cdmg from holy chant, along with 2% d-dmg, BUT: Allows you to use s1 enchant cards (eg more pen) and higher base stats. This makes it a compelling upgrade for those at s5 who need a minor power boost, while being almost completely free.

**Bottom Armor**

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| (+20) [S10 Grand Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20903-evil-conqueror-belt-armor) - Blacksmithing, also known as Evil Conqueror set. | (+20~30) [S10 Grand Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20903-evil-conqueror-belt-armor) - Blacksmithing, also known as Evil Conqueror set. | (+30) [S10 Grand Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20903-evil-conqueror-belt-armor) - Blacksmithing, also known as Evil Conqueror set. |
| (+20) [S1 Timber Fairy Blood](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19457-forest-belt) - Blacksmithing, also known as Forest set. | (+20~30) [S1 Timber Fairy Blood](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19457-forest-belt) - Blacksmithing, also known as Forest set. | N/A |
| 

- [S10 Grand Aura](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20903-evil-conqueror-belt-armor) - Blacksmithing, also known as Evil Conqueror set.
  - 12% detail damage and a proc for 15% crit rate to bosses, 15% crit damage to bosses.
  - This set is better than Guardian Knight (clearly) due to that set being defensive. It's also strictly better than Ninja, which also provides detail damage and crit rate, but less of both and no crit damage.
- [S1 Timber Fairy Blood](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19457-forest-belt). Orange, also known as Forest set
  - 10% dmg, 35% cdmg to bosses. 
  - +20 the set, use s1 cards
  - This set is compelling if and only if you a.) made it at s1 b.) have it at a reasonably high fortification level, and c.) are lacking crit damage. At this point in the game, detail damage becomes the second scaling stat in the game to become significant due to instance "damage dealt" nerfs. Consequently, the 12% from s10 is actually considered to maybe be better than 10% dmg and the extra crit damage, especially if you have a lot of it from elsewhere already.


**Trophy**

Very little changes here, with the exception of Fatima's Thunder Boost becoming technically better than Souler. However, this being worth building is rare due to the fort costs.

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| (+20) [Level 95 Cultural Relic](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/items?q%5Bs%5D=min_lvl_nl+desc&q%5Bname_cont%5D=Cultural+Relic&q%5Btype_id_eq%5D=1039) | (+20) [Level 95 Cultural Relic](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/items?q%5Bs%5D=min_lvl_nl+desc&q%5Bname_cont%5D=Cultural+Relic&q%5Btype_id_eq%5D=1039) | (+30) [Time and Destiny Set (there's 2!)](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/46851-time-and-years) | 
| (+20) [S5 Fatima's Thunder Boost](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19593-fatimas-thunder-boost) | (+20) [S5 Fatima's Thunder Boost](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19593-fatimas-thunder-boost) | (+30) [Genki Skyforged Set (there's 2!)](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/46462-secret-stone-of-divine-element-celestial-rune) |
| (+20) [Level 95 Delfonia's Exquisite Earrings](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18321-delfonias-exquisite-earrings) | (+20) [S1 Souler - Deadly Ice Ring](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19588-souler-deadly-ice-ring) | (+30) [Bond Set (there's 2!)](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/32880-bond-eternal-sorrow) |

- [Level 95 Cultural Relic](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/items?q%5Bs%5D=min_lvl_nl+desc&q%5Bname_cont%5D=Cultural+Relic&q%5Btype_id_eq%5D=1039)
  - By far one of the best trophies in the game. Keep working on +30ing it. Use if you don't use Bond. This is better due to the 20% attribute damage, and is especially good if you are a dark class. Elemental damage can sometimes be hard to come by, and you need to keep it's scaling up to par with the other elements of the dps formula
- [S5 Fatima's Thunder Boost](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19593-fatimas-thunder-boost)
  - Grants 25% CDMG and a 10% chance to grant 50% dmg on the next attack. This is clearly better than Delfonia's and thus knocks it off the list.
  - This is better than Souler because of the CDMG. However, building a new gold trophy may be questionable.
- [S1 Souler - Deadly Ice Ring](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/19588-souler-deadly-ice-ring)
  - A decent def shred crafted trophy. +20 it. Use if you don't use Bond and have some money.
  - Def shred becomes really powerful after a certain point. Reducing a mob's defense value from .8 to .75 (by just 6%)is enough to 1.5x your damage under certain circumstances.

- [Level 95 Delfonia's Exquisite Earrings](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/18321-delfonias-exquisite-earrings)
  - A +35% dmg on next attack trophy. It's very strong, however requires 10% chance on a crit (which should be 100% of the time) and can occur at most every other attack.
- [Bond Trophies](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/items?q%5Bs%5D=min_lvl_nl+desc&q%5Bname_cont%5D=Bond&q%5Btype_id_eq%5D=1039)
  - A collection of trophies that are pretty decent, but are extremely expensive. Provides pen and armor piercing scaling stats. Most players will not afford this set.
  - There are multiple bond sets. The [Flower Sprite](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/32880-bond-eternal-sorrow) set is likely the best set that's accessible, but the [Otherworld Link](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/32888-bond-cyclone-link) set is theoretically not bad either. 
- P2W sets (Genki Skyforged Set, Time & Destiny Set)
  - Probably worth hundreds of thousands of gold. Clearly better but literally only use it if you're 1.) an alt 2.) rich as heck. I think that which one is better is technical and build specific, but generally Time & Destiny set should be better in most situations.

In general, `P2W > Bond > Relic + Souler`, assuming you have the damage to support bond being better than relic.

**Accessories**

Nothing changes!

| Low End | Mid End | High End |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | 
| N/A | (+20) [S5 Demonic Release](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20646-crown-of-agni) - DP book, EST, commonly known as Agni's Set. | (+30) [S5 Heavenly Seal](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/47015-path-of-inquiry-soul-chain) - ""holy crap"" |
| N/A |  (+20) [Level 95 Wild Howl](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20228-ladias-alchemy) - DP book  | (+30) [S5 Endless Abyss Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/46790-abyss-soul-shackles) - aka Abyss set |
| N/A | N/A | (+30) [S5 Demonic Release](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20646-crown-of-agni) - DP book, EST, commonly known as Agni's Set. |

- [S5 Demonic Release (Agni's)](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20646-crown-of-agni): BY FAR the best vanilla set in the game. It can be exchanged for with 15k GDP and 25 sky tower sigils per piece (so 45k GDP and 75 sigils total)
  - Provides an 8% chance to give 150% cdmg cap.
  - This is *really important*. Players have a huge amount of crit damage sources, but typically only 300% base cdmg cap. You can get another 80-100 from various sources but >~400% cdmg cap is nowhere near enough to account for the 500+ that most players end up getting. Agni's is thus, for almost all high level players in almost all situations, essentially a 150% crit damage buff.
- [Level 95 Wild Howl](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20228-ladias-alchemy):
  - If you do not have the crit damage to overcap your crit damage by at least 50%, wild howl is still likely better for you to *use*. However, this is typically not an excuse to not build agni's. You can continue using this, but build agni's on the side.
- [Heavenly Seal](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/47015-path-of-inquiry-soul-chain): 
  - Putting this on here is unironically a joke because you actually need the Abyss set in order to get the Heavenly Seal set (and more!). It's strictly an upgrade to Abyss, but is literally impossible to get because you need a formula that's *also* para only.
  - Provides (if you include procs) 48% cdmg, 52% d-dmg, 20% mspd, 40 armor piercing, 20% pen, 20% attribute d-dmg, 50% def shred, 150% cdmg cap, 30% skill d-dmg, 20% almighty nerf. 
- [Abyss Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/46790-abyss-soul-shackles)
  - An extremely powerful set that provides tons of base stats, pen/armor piercing/mspd, crit damage cap (and is consequently a strictly better upgrade than Agni's), tons of detail damage from/to elements, and 2 very powerful debuffs.
  - However, it's para only and are really expensive to get. There is demand for it but frequently no market.

**Mount**
- Use a Level 4 Elemental Dmg % mount (or whatever is highest level).
- You might want to start acquiring an Almighty mount. You may need it at later levels. They tend to be much more expensive than ele%, but can be useful to help cap stats when instances start nerfing you really hard.

**Secret Stones**
- Weapon - Lava Secret Stones
- Armor - Purple Secret Stones (upgraded from Orange)
- Reroll using reroll pots to get dmg%. Aim for the highest percent possible with current pots. dmg% rerolls (with the exception of 7% on lava main) are actually detail damage, which is an important scaling stat.

**Emblem**
- Highest ELE% possible on an emblem. Goes up to 8+17=25%. You should be using one of the special types (eg Darkshadow Gaia Emblem) which guarantee the 8%.
- You can choose to work on other stats as well at this point, but elemental damage will *always* be the main objective for emblems.
- If you're rich, you should buy one of the Eido Blessing emblems, or the ones with the fancy swirly pentagon logos like [War Roar](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/33339-war-roar-emblem), or [Mistress of Moonshadow](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/23752-mistress-of-moonshadow-emblem). These are clearly better than the base emblems.

**Holy Spirit**

A new armor slot unlocked by being in awakening levels. All Holy Spirits are acquired from DT, with the exception of the gold upgrades which are unlocked from combining the former orange and a recipe dropped from nightmare dungeons. This means that you need to either run DT or buy the item from someone else.

- [Golden Horn](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/21612-golden-horn)
  - Provides def shred. It's my opinion that this is better, because you should really have cap crit (even accounting for instance nerfs) at this level if you take into consideration other crit sources. Additionally, it's a decent amount of flat def shred (2.5k of it almost) over the % cap.
- [Night Owl Arrow](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/21613-night-owl-arrow)
