# Guild Instances
The guild instances, accessible in the guild panel -> guild instance tab, are a series of dungeons that can be run by guild members. They are a great way to get some extra rewards, and can be run every week per character.

# Rewards
The instances give, per instance,
- 100 guild contribution points
- 50 LP
- Cyril's Key Fragment
- [Lion King Trinket Chest](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/17871-lion-king-trinket-chest) (redeemable for an [orange mount](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/50367-overlorddarknight-lion-emperor))
- 200 LP

The rewards are not the most significant but given how little time this takes, it's a good way to get some extra LP and guild contribution points. You also receive guild contribution coins from the bosses. Guild contribution can be used in the guild UI here:

and then going to Special Donations.

This will give you guild funds. Those guild funds can then be used at the guild shop (At Navea `760,363`) to buy various rewards, like crafting materials, in Navea between the portal and blacksmith.

# Instances

All bosses and mobs in these instances are level 99. However, none of them are particularly difficult and don't have any armor & only a mil HP & 37k def, so if you have a reasonable amount of gear you should be able to clear if you're underleveled.

## Rescue Operation - Rehia
This instance is pretty trivial. You load in and are greeted by Yeshe. Then, run to the central room to watch a cutscene.

![1-1](https://i.imgur.com/PJXBB0H.png)

After the cutscene, there will be a channel of traps you will need to navigate.

![1-2](https://i.imgur.com/oGz0dyF.png)

Be careful not to get hit by them - they do a lot of damage. If you're really high level and tanky, you may be able to just run through them.

After the traps, you will be greeted by a boss Rehia. This boss is pretty easy, just nuke Rehia

![1-3](https://i.imgur.com/K3251hl.png)

You will receive the clear reward in the mail, along with boss rewards

## Rescue Operation - Yeshe
Start by walking up to the vines. This starts a cutscene with Yeshe. If you don't do this cutscene, you can't progress.

![2-1](https://i.imgur.com/TbWUZBp.png)

Then walk up the stairs and nuke Yeshe. Some mobs will spawn after, which you also need to kill.

![2-2](https://i.imgur.com/OgIuRBM.png)

Then you get to the "find the real Yeshe" room, where you need to kill the correct Yeshe. If you kill the wrong one, a level 99 mob spawns that you need to kill before you can try again. If you guess right, you can nuke Yeshe again. To be honest, your best bet is to just kill at random until you get it right, because there's no pattern lmao.

![2-3](https://i.imgur.com/ehZGHRe.png)

Then, go up the stairs and nuke Yeshe for the 3rd time to end the instance.

## Rescue Operation - Moe

Enter the instance, walk up the stairs, and stand in the red circle.

![3-1](https://i.imgur.com/hSUUMs5.png)

Then, you'll see a lot of rotating flame bars. Make your way through carefully if you're low level, but if you're high level they really don't do too much damage. Shoot the trap switch at the end of each flame maze to progress. Standing on the blue circles will extinguish any burn damage you're receiving.

![3-2](https://i.imgur.com/cpjiDAo.png)

After the flame mazes, you'll be greeted by Moe. Nuke Moe and the mini Moes that spawn after he dies.

## Rescue Operation - Cole

This is the first "party" instance. You can bring a party into this instance by being the party leader, and all your party members being same channel and being at this stage of the guild quests line. However, you can just solo this lol

Enter the instance and talk to Yeshe. Click the "Let me find them! (Begin)" option.

You then have to help the other rescued so far. Go behind you and walk up to each one. 

![4-1](https://i.imgur.com/luGARuv.png)

- For Rehia, you just need to kill the evil mobs that spawn after watching a short cutscene
- For Moe, you need to either pay 1 gold to him, or click "Don't mind them, let's make a run for it!", at which point you just kill the evil mobs as well. 

Then, after a short bit, you get a grey screen text box, and start the cooking phase.

### THE COOKING PHASE (oh no)

![4-2](https://i.imgur.com/FexxJbh.png)

Essentially, you are presented with a ton of ingredients. You talk to Zinnia to start this phase by selecting the "I am ready, let's begin" option. Then, Zinnia will announce ingredients she needs above her head. It will be repeated as a banner at the top of the screen. You must select the ingredient and then walk over Moe, Yeshe, or Rehia, depending on whose pile you are taking the ingredient from.

![4-3](https://i.imgur.com/AI4sMc6.png) 

For instance here, Zinnia wants a mushroom. You go over to Moe's pile, pick up a Mushroom (you will get a buff status that indicates you did so), and then walk over Moe, who will say a line to indicate he got it, and then Zinnia will indicate if you got it right or not. Repeat this until the noodles are done. 

There's a translation bug to do with the mushrooms specifically. The "Flavoring Mushroom" that Zinnia wants are the "Fresh Mushrooms" that are in the pile. When Zinnia wants mushrooms for color, she means the "Dew Mushrooms".

This likely stems from mushrooms and herbs having very similar names in the TW version? Not sure. Either way, getting this one wrong a few times doesn't even matter that much because its overall performance that matters.

Then, Ancient Evil Cole will spawn, who you then kill. 

## Rescue Operation - Grass Kingdom

This is an instance where you go around collecting skills to break barriers. There are multiple possible "sets" of locations for the skills.

### Yeshe

Start off by talking to Yeshe and selecting "Please teach me how to lift the first curse!"

![5-1](https://i.imgur.com/2ysCLGL.png)

Then, you will be given a red skill to break the first barrier. Use it on the barrier to progress (select as shown in picture). You will also have a red halo under your feet to indicate you have the skill.

![5-2](https://i.imgur.com/VBCBXYn.png)

The gimmick of this instance is collecting all the skills to break all the barriers. You do this by using the barrier breaking skill on glowing orbs and hoping to find Moe, Rehia, and Cole.

However, they spawn in the same place every time.

### Moe

After breaking the red barrier, start breaking red orbs using your 1 skill. Moe will be hidden in one of them. The coordinates are consistent every run for each character, so it may be advisable to write down the coordinates for your locations.

You can find your map coordinates on the minimap in the top right corner. In the picture below I am also standing on the orb in question.

![5-3](https://i.imgur.com/YDHYyl6.png)

After breaking the orb, Moe will come out

![5-4](https://i.imgur.com/3XMrVAg.png)

Talk to him, learn how to break the blue curse, and break the large blue barrier. 

### Rehia

Then, start looking for Rehia in the new area unlocked..

This is sometimes a blue orb and sometimes a red orb. If it's a red orb, go back to Yeshe and ask for the red skill. 

Then talk to Rehia and learn how to break the green curse.

![5-5](https://i.imgur.com/ehlEFRw.png)

Then, break the large green barrier.

### Cole

Now, start looking for Cole in the new area unlocked. Once again, if the orb he's in is not green, just go back and get the right color. 

![5-6](https://i.imgur.com/C7Kp53a.png)

Cole will teach you to break the golden curse, which gives you 4 curse break skills. You no longer need the other colors.

Now, just clear the remaining barriers by using the skill one by one on each device. Each barrier will take progressively more casts to break. Use the barrier breaking skill that matches with the color of the barrier.

There is another translation error where the skill names for blue and green are swapped. Ignore the names, just use the color of the skill icon.

Then, watch another cutscene and kill the Ancient Evil, and you're done!
