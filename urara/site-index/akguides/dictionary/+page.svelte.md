Alias means other terms that are used to refer to the same thing. I only put "common" words and aliases in. I'm not defining to you what every shorthand and term means because most of them are intuitive. I'm trying to give ones that are unintuitive.

Note that this dictionary is a little messy, is not in alphabetical order, is not comprehensive, and also includes both acronyms and real definitions. Please do not treat this as any official guide in any form.

# Stats/Gear
| Term | Definition | Aliases |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| DMG | Raw weapon dmg stat, seen as is in your character panel. This is weapon dependent (i.e. you likely have higher main weapon dmg) |
| Pen | Penetration, used for awakening+ tier bosses with armor. THE MOST IMPORTANT scaling stat. You want around 70 to clear s1/5 pt dungeons comfortably. Visible in detailed statistics -> offense -> scroll to bottom |
| Crit | Critical chance. Based on the raw crit stat, this gives you extra Crit Damage cap for any overcap after you hit awakening. |
| Cdmg | Critical damage %. Your total Crit Damage is NOT the crit damage shown on the character panel, but is mob and context specific. We typically optimize for bosses. Thus, your C-Dmg is (in detailed stats -> offensive) the Crit Damage of your main weapon + Crit Damage to bosses. Then, add on any envoy or % procs. This is your total Cdmg | C-Dmg, CD |
| Cdmg Cap | Critical Damage Cap. Defaulting at 300, you should try your best to always fulfill this. There are a few sources of CDmg Cap, but the most common is Agni's set. Your total Cdmg as shown above should be roughly at or slightly below your cap. | CD Cap, CDC |
| Acc | Accuracy, important for hitting things. If you don't have enough accuracy, you will just miss mobs. Keep a minimum of 60% in awakening+ if possible. |
| Scaling Stat | A stat that is so critical to the game that it exponentially scales your ability to do damage at high levels. Irregardless of any other stat you have, these singlehandedly decide how much damage you do due to very powerful negative nerfs on them. You must maintain a higher scaling stat than the stat nerf in an instance or mob to do significant damage. The 3 scaling stats are Pen, Pogun, and Detail Damage |
| [Overcap](https://tinyurl.com/ipokeovercapstuff) | An s1 mechanic where getting stats above the cap gives you bonus stats. Crit -> CDC, Spd -> Zeal, Def -> Max HP%, Eva -> True Eva | OC |
| Pogun | Armor Piercing. A scaling stat, this applies to extremely high level party instances (s15+) where mobs come with an additional armor stat. |
| D-Dmg | Detail Damage, which is (in detailed stats -> offensive), main weapon damage + damage to bosses (or whatever you are targeting) + dmg from element. Really important scaling stat, as high level instances apply very heavy -dmg dealt% nerfs. | Dmg Dealt |
| Zeal | Any statistic that offers doing extra damage as a multiple of your base damage at a % proc | Dual Drive, DD |
| Envoy | Envoy's Path, the skill tree system in AK. AKDB has a useful envoy path designer. |
| SS | Secret Stone. Optimal secret stones are typically purple evolved stones for armor and lava stones for weapons. Rerolled secret stones are a powerful source of D-Dmg, as the "dmg%" legend masteries upon reroll are mistranslated - they are actually detailed damage. A notable exception to this is the Lava stone 7% dmg, which is in fact real dmg%. |
| Acc | Accessory. A critical set, the current meta is Agni's s5. |
| HC | Holy Chest, in your inventory -> holy chest cabinet. You receive bonus detailed damage to elements depending on what weapon you put in. Different *classes* of weapons (i.e. warbow, sorc) frequently provide different bonuses. Other than the different class weapons (which all provide dp, then some % typically dark/holy) there are the dragon weapons from abyss, which give dmg reduction and storm/fire/lightning/ice %. |
| AHC | Awakening Holy Chest, s1 tier HC with super buffs. You must sacrifice high fortification gold weapons for a chance of upgrading a level. At high levels this buff is extremely powerful.
| Archive | Eido Archive or Costume Archive, context dependent. Both are extremely important and grant pen/raw stats, with eido archive singlehandedly being the most important objective of the game. |
| [Agni](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/search?s=agni) | An s5 accessory set that gives +150% cdmg cap. This is extremely powerful and many endgame players use it. It is definitively the single most powerful set in the game, and is better than battle soul set. |
| [Abyss Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/46790-abyss-soul-shackles) | A super expensive p2w set that gives a ton of stats. Worth a stupid amount of gold, they are para only | 
| [Time and Years](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/46851-time-and-years) | A super expensive p2w trophy that gives a ton of stats. Also worth absurd amounts, para only |
| Abyss Card | Special costume enchants that give a lot of stats. Not to be confused at all with Abyss Set |
| [Howl Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/20228-ladias-alchemy) | Level 95 gold set that is meta for awakening and up until Agni's |
| [Battle Soul Set](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/21986-faiths-tusk-of-fighting-soul) | An s15 set that is a good alternative to Agni's. It provides only 60% cdmg cap while also giving more raw stats and 10% d-dmg. Theoretical calculations prove that this is at least 20% worse than Agni's if you are at cdmg cap thanks to archive/ext stats. |
| Noct | Nocturnal, a type of weapon that heals you a % of the damage you dealt. The vast majority of players use nocturnal on an orange sub weapon to provide passive healing. This frees up the mount slot and can even allow them to sub other classes if they were dependent on bard heals. |
| Imperial | A core enchant that provides mspd. Highly sought after by endgame players who don't care about stats anymore. |
| Destroyer | A core enchant that provides def shred at a %. The meta for main weapon cores if you're using orange, but will also proc if on a sub (although you are then giving up noct) | 
| [Book](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/41113-dark-aura-manual) | A really powerful & expensive para only item that gives a ton of stats, providing party buffs to all members and a stronoger buff to the individual who owns it. | Aura Manual, Manual |
| [Fusion Book](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/item/41534-explosive-chaos-manual) | Upgraded version of an Aura Manual that gives even more dumb amounts of stats. Worth a stupid amount of gold, these are currently exclusively available after buying 2 books and paying a considerable amount of irl money for a fusion. |

# Dungeons/Instances
| Term | Definition | Aliases |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| DH | Dimensional Hall, daily high xp quest instance. Requires at least 2 people to complete. |
| [Bond](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zones?q%5Btype_eq%5D=121) | A series of 2 player, puzzle based s10/s20 instances that give very expensive trophies, LP, and dragon points. |
| DP + TR | Dawn Passage and Titan's Root, the location of 2 of the bond dungeons. This bond run intentionally skips otherworld link, as it's both long and prone to softlocks. | 
| [VOE](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zones?q%5Btype_eq%5D=109&q%5Bunk52_eq%5D=1609) | Vault of Eternity, an s1 instance that gives a lot of LP, sprites, and other valuables. Accompanying it's extraordinary rewards also is extraordinary difficulty, with only extremely powerful s25+ characters (or alts of such characters, which carry over many of the stats from eido archive) typically able to carry it. | VoE |
| [Philae](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zone/1157-hall-of-philae-explorer-base) | A lv65 archeology star sand instance that has the potential of dropping elemental trophies. | 
| [Gaia](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zones?q%5Btype_eq%5D=109&q%5Bzone_id_in%5D%5B%5D=1152&q%5Bzone_id_in%5D%5B%5D=1156&q%5Bzone_id_in%5D%5B%5D=1178&q%5Bzone_id_in%5D%5B%5D=1179&q%5Bzone_id_in%5D%5B%5D=1180) | The 3 Gaia Sanctuary instances in Crescent Hill. The primary method of gaining basic eidolon keys in the early game, a medium source of LP, a lot of DP (since all eidos are classified as bosses), bonding value for GKs, and the only consistent source of elemental crests for eidos. |
| Temple | The Eidolon Temple instance in Crescent Hill. On a 6 hour reset, this has a high chance of dropping 100+(type tier-1)*50 LP for any non Cesela spawn (up to 200 LP for the level 60 spawn). This is a very consistent early game LP source |
| [ST](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zones?q%5Bmin_lvl_eq%5D=60&q%5Btype_eq%5D=105) | lv60 instance, Sky Tower, Floors 1-25, on Sun/Thurs. Typically only run in public raids because the level of players now are high enough to complete, these are a big source of DP. | 
| [EST](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zones?q%5Bmin_lvl_eq%5D=60&q%5Btype_eq%5D=105) | lv60 instance, Elite Sky Tower, Floors 26-50, on Fri. F25 of EST is required to enter. Rarely run due to it's lackluster rewards and lack of DP benefits, it's almost exclusively run by guilds for achievements on rare occasions. Because of it's rarity and lack of clears, you typically want to skip EST by not hitting f25 of ST for HST. |
| [HST](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zones?q%5Bmin_lvl_eq%5D=60&q%5Btype_eq%5D=105) | lv60 instance, Hero Sky Tower, floors 51-70, on Sat. You either need to have cleared F50 of EST, or have not killed ST floor 25 to enter. Difficult enough for current players to warrant only being clearable by highly organized 1.5  hour+ guild raids. |
| [Sky Realm](https://www.aurakingdom-db.com/zones?q%5Bmin_lvl_eq%5D=70&q%5Btype_eq%5D=105) | A sky tower esque instance that runs on Tuesday and drops Sky Realm sigils. Commonly farmed for the eidolon Tanith |
| PP | Pyroclastic Purgatory, a Dragon King instance which drops lava secret stones |
| Dragon King | A series of instances that specialize in dropping dragon points |
| TT | Tempestuous Temple, a Dragon King instance |
| DT | Divine Trial, a PVP instance. This drops the materials required for holy spirits, an s1+ gear item that can sometimes sell for huge amounts of money. It is one of the few pvp events that has equal stats/gear, so is accessible to all. |
| HVE | Holy vs Evil Showdown, a PVP instance |
| Gossip | Eidolon Gossip instances, lv60 dungeons that can give eido keys |
| Nightmare | Extremely difficult s5, s10 instances that drop nightmare emblems | 
| VV | Vulture's Vale, lv60 main world field map. Meant for guild quests that give guild contribution, but also known for goat raids. |
| BB | Blizzard Berg, lv60 main world field map. Meant for guild quests that give guild contribution, but also known for goat raids. |
| SIF | Silent Ice Field, lv66 main world field map |
| WSH | White Spirit Hill, s5 main world field map |
| ESP | Emerald Spring Peaks, s5 main world field map |
| DP | Dawn Passage, s1 instance |
| SAC | Silent Ancient Castle, s1 instance |
| AST | Ancestral Spirit Temple, s5 instance |
| Abyss Instance | A series of 4 "dragon" instances that have a ton of waves of mobs with dragon eidolon bosses in between. Drop keys and useful weapons for holy chest |
| Mirabelle | The mirabelle instances/quests from the notice board. |
| Quiz | The Aura Kingdom Quiz, a daily quiz that can give you some minor free stuff |
