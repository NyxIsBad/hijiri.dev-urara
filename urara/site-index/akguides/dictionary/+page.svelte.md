Alias means other terms that are used to refer to the same thing. I only put "common" words and aliases in. I'm not defining to you what every shorthand and term means because most of them are intuitive. I'm trying to give ones that are unintuitive.

Note that this dictionary is a little messy, is not in alphabetical order, is not comprehensive, and also includes both acronyms and real definitions. Please do not treat this as any official guide in any form.
