I'll cook all foods, but the price depends on which food, common foods below. We don't cook foods below 80 because they're generally too expensive for how bad they are (and low leveled players really don't need them)

First number is if you don't bring the blue (or gathered) mats, second is if you do. 

If you put in an order it may take a while. Plz don't resell, this is meant to be a relatively cheap price for guildies.

## Please note that there may be translation errors in the game! 
For instance, golden latte is well known by the community to actually give 12% Detail Damage, not 12% Damage. If a food is not well known, its true effects may also be unknown to me since I've never used them.

## Bonus Shorthands:
- Mspd = Movement Speed
- D-Dmg = Detail Damage
- XP = Experience Gained (from monsters)
- CD = Critical Damage
- CDR = Critical Damage Received
- ⭐ = This food requires a dungeon locked resource. Only noted for common foods (but could apply if buying uncommon foods)
