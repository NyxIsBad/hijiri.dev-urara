## Description

[Clearvision](https://github.com/ClearVision) is a project created by myself and other members of the ClearVision organization, or the ClearVision Team. It is designed to customize discord, a chatting platform 

It's a theme written in scss and hosted on github. You can install it via any discord injector that supports .theme.css files, such as [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) or [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/).

## Support

You can find me and the rest of the team at [our support discord](https://discord.gg/7pNUC9C), or just open an issue on our repo.
